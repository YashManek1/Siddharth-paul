            I know a lot of gurus show random fake screenshots. That's why I've
            attached my actual bank statements and PayPal proofs from April.
            I'll share even more inside the courses â€” but not all here, as too
            much proof starts looking fake ðŸ˜‚. This is more than enough to trust
            my products. And if you ever feel I under-deliver, you can reach out
            on Insta or use my 7-day no-questions-asked refund policy.
